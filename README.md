# book-club

book-club administers most of the processes that are typically carried out in a running real-life book-club. The processes implemented are:

* membership registration
* stocking of library with books
* lending out books (with priority in a case of limited books)
* keeping record of borrowers and borrowed books

# specifics

* A member falls under staff or student
* A staff has higher priority than a student
* Between two members under the same category, the member that registered earlier has higher priority.
